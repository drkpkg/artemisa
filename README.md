Artemisa, System of management veterinary clinic and animal refuge

For the moment this software is current in development, i'm trying to finish it ASAP.

INSTRUCTIONS:

 - Download the code
 - Create a .env file. See the .env example
 - Run bundle install
 - Run rake
    - rake db:create db:migrate db:setup
    In some rails versions is:
    - rake db:setup
 -rails s

If you want contribute with code, ideas or feedback will be awesome. I'm not a rails senior but i'm trying to do my best work :)

TODO:

 - Localization
 - Restful API for mobile version
 - Uploading files
 - Setup configuration page
 - Animal refuge mode

I will adding more things in the list if I have an idea.
